_This project will remain in progress for improvements_


## Problem Statement

Given an excel file, we are required to extract date sheet according to batch and section like (**FA18-BSE-A**)


## Acknowledgements

_WE DON NOT OWN ANY DATA_

_Our Datasets Resource for this Project is **Excel File** given by examination department_

  
## Technologies used

Following are the main technologies, used in this project

- Python
- Jupyter Lab

    Install it using the following pip command in CMD
    ```
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```


## How to Use

_Step 1_: Give path to DateSheet (Excel FIle)

_Step 2_: Enter your Batch along with section (In case your batch has more than one sections) like **FA18-BSE-A**

That's all! You will get your datesheet
